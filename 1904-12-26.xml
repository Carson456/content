                    <p>EGYPT'S FINANCES,</p>
                    <p>The Financial Adviser's Note on the Budget, which we reproduce in our columns of
                        to-day, bears sufficiently strong testimony to the advantages of the
                        Anglo-French "entente" to convince Lord Rosebery himself, while its summing up
                        of the financial situation of Egypt should furnish a sufficient refutation, were
                        refutation needed, of the critics who persist in affirming that the country is
                        being exploited by a Power whose relations with H. H. the Khedive and his people
                        have never been more cordial. On the other hand, there is no suspicion of
                        optimism, no trace of that pardonable but somewhat naif self-satisfaction, which
                        British statesmen have at times betrayed at home while complacently reviewing
                        the results of other people's labors or inspired by the communicative warmth of
                        Imperialist banquets. Pace the ingenious Joseph,' the latter failing is rare
                        among Eoglishmen in Egypt, but there is every temptation to a high authority on
                        matters financial to wax ultra-optimistic when he considers the extraordinary
                        progress achieved in the face of toreign opposition and national insolvency,
                        Financially speaking, Egypt is in the saddle ; we can hardly trust her to go for
                        long rides!</p>

                        Corbett sees far more clearly than some of the native critics of the
                        administration that, to use an analogy, there is no reason for a man who has
                        just paid off all his youthful debts, acquired a steady income, and won the
                        respect and trust of his neighbours by his honesty and method, to celebrate the
                        payment of the last bill dating from some twenty years back by an orgie of
                        extravagance.</p>
                    <p>We hope to discuss the Note fully in the near future. One point more remains-to |
                        bestow well-merited praise both on its manner and, may we say, its manners. The
                        style is masterly and incisive ; there are no rhetorical flourishes, and while
                        readers may disagree with its criticisms or its reply to their own criticisms,
                        they cannot be hurt, be they ever 80 thin-skinned. We have our selves expressed
                        opinions which the Financial Adviser combats in his present Note, and we admire
                        not only the skill of his dialectio but the perfect courtesy of his criticism.
                        Reports emanating from other Ministries have been known to fail in this respect
                        owing to the inability of their writers to realise the fact that rapier play,
                        thoughts ceremony may seem punctilious and absurd, is altogether more graceful
                        and effective than bludgeonwork.</p>
                    <p>SUEZ CANAL 11. Sir Theodore Angier has a good deal to do yet before he gets his
                        second Suez Canal. It seeing to be clear that the directors of the present canal
                        -as is the way of monopolistshave not treated customers with the considera tion
                        which might be expected. In defiance of the agreement of 1883, they have
                        increased the dividend beyond 15 per cent.--to 26, in point of fact--without
                        first reducing the tonnage dues to 5 francs. At the same time, the building of
                        another canal seems a somewhat extreme remedy. It would cost, on the lowest
                        computation, six millions ; and though Sir Theodore asserts that the traffic
                        would be "simply doubled," not everyone will share his airy cor fidence. It does
                        not always follow that because you cut a second door in a room, twice as many
                        people will pass in and out as when there was only one. Most formidable of all
                        is the concession difficulty. It is extremely unlikely that the Egyptian
                        Governinent would permit, or would be permitted to permit, the construo. tion of
                        another canal side by side with the first.</p>

                        throwing hand grenades, but tailed to drive out the Japanese. Despite the
                        bombardment, the Japanese succeeued in buildig defensive works on the

                    <head>FATAL RAILWAY SMASH. TRAIN DE LUXE IN COLLISION.</head>
                    <p>ONE KILLED, SEVERAL INJURED.</p>
                    <p>(From Our CORRESPONDENT.)</p>
                    <p>Keneh, December 25. The sleeping and restaurant car train, which was due at
                        Keueh at 7 a.m. to-day, has only just arrived, nine hours late owing to a
                        collision at Kafr Ammar.</p>
                    <p>We learn from a reliable, and in fact official, source the following details
                        concerning the collision which occurred at Kafr Ammar on "Xmas Eve :</p>
                    <p>The 6.30 Luxor train, which had fortunately slowed down before passing
                        through the station, where it does not stop, ran straight into + a slow
                        train which was standing beside the platform. Fortanately, any great loss of
                        life was averted by the fact that the tourists, many of whom were on the
                        train, had just left the dining-car and that a crate and luggage van was
                        interposed between the engine and the above-mentioned car.</p>
                    <p>The loss of life was greatly exaggerated in l. Cairo on Saturday night,
                        rumours being current that from 30 to 60 persons had been killed or
                        seriously injured. As a matter of fact, I. the cook's assistant, an Arab,
                        who had beer' : five years in the company's service, and who leaves several
                        children, was the only victim.</p>
                    <p>Two cases of severe injuries are reported. The chef, Mr. E. Batfiglia, who
                        was standing near his assistant at the time of the collision, was thrown
                        down with such' violence that one of his legs was broken. He was also
                        injured by the splinters and fragments of the fore part of the dining car,
                        which was completely wrecked, and burnt and scalded owing to the overturning
                        of the dining-car boiler and cooking arrangements. Mr. Disertis, the maitre
                        d'hotel, La was severely bruised and shaken, and has been sent to
                        Alexandria, where he lives.</p>
                    <p>Of the passengers, about a dozen were more or less shaken and bruised.
                        Several of them describe the shock as having been terrific. All the lights
                        in the train went out, and al. terrible crash was heard. Fortunately the le
                        passengers kept their heads and there seems to have been no panic.</p>
                    <p>Immediately on the receipt of the news in Cairo, a special breakdown train
                        proceeded to le the scene of disaster, conveying Major, L'Estrange
                        Johustone, Scander Pasta Febmy, 11 Mr. Trevithick, Mr. Hood,' and several
                        other li railway ofhcials, with Drs. Murison and li Schameil. · The Luxor
                        train was able to start at mid-li night on its journey South.</p>
                    <p>-As for the material damage done, the diving car is &amp; total wreck, two
                        brake and baggage vans have also been wrecked. Both locomotives are badly
                        damaged, and two or more fish waggons have sustained considerable
                        damage.</p>
                    <p>An enquiry into the cause of the accident will begin to-morrow.</p>
                    <p>We may point out that it is just at Kafr | Ammar that the double line ceases,
                        the work of doubling the line from Luxor being still in progress south of
                        this point.</p>

                    <p>CORPORATION.</p>
                    <p>SCHEME FOR DEVELOPING TRADE.</p>
                    <p>Discussing a scheme for combination in the export trade of the United
                        Kingdom, a writer | I in Commercial Intelligence says :</p>
                    <p>No scheme yet devised to meet any evil can be inaugurated or carried through
                        to success without difficulties presenting themselves. We may, however,
                        sketch briefly, what is in our ! minds, and, as an example, we will take
                        Egypt, It for instance, as an, imaginary field for our enterprise. What
                        would apply to that country would apply with equal force to a dozen others.
                        1 &amp;</p>
                    <p>To sells goods it is necessary to put them | before buyers. To slowly develop
                        a trade cata logues serve a useful purpose ; samples also are useful, but
                        they touch only the fifinge of the question, and being in nearly every /
                        case explained in the English language, thøy are understandable only by the
                        recognised whole sale, and importing houses, who already have their
                        arrangeinents with other countries and are unwilling to disturb them. These
                        houses N are there to make a profit, and they make it, and it is only common
                        sense that they should prefer to abide by the existing conditions which are
                        working well, rather than bring new ones into being in which there may be no
                        profit. This vested interest which knows and understands international
                        trading is, therefore, settled in its operations. The English manuIfacturer
                        must go direct to the retail buyers, and the must approach them in their own
                        language, under their buying conditions, and be in the position of a local
                        house. Competent travellers and managers with linguistic attainments are,
                        therefore, necessary, and these, cost money.</p>
                    <p>We, therefore, propose trading corporations. Let an Anglo-Egyptian Trade
                        Corporation be formed with, say, &amp; capital of £10,000, £5,000 of which
                        might be by way of debentures placed with those who show their Sympathy with
                        the movement and the remainder in shares taken up by manufacturers willing
                        and desirous of extending their foreign trade. We will say that ten
                        manufacturers provide £500 each, or twenty manufacturers $250 each.
                        Increased prices, commensurate with the trouble and expense involved, could
                        easily be obtained. The-Corporation would have competent directors in London
                        selected from the manufacturers interested to superintend the dispatch of
                        the goods; and competent directors in Egypt to control the reception of the
                        merchandise in bulk, and its distribution to customers, to invoice goods in
                        the currency of the country, and to collect the accounts when due. The
                        present difficulty in collecting foreign accounts is due to the lack of
                        facilities at the disposal of manufacturers rather than to the lack of
                        principle on the part of the customer. The manufacturer would de: Tliver to
                        a London warehouse where other</p>
                    <p>classes of goods would accumulate, and the packing could thus be carried on
                        in a most economical and busiriesslike way. Nothing but goods of British
                        origin would be handled. The management in Egypt would procure merchandise
                        from the Egyptian producers for the English market, making advances (in
                        conjunction with a bank) against them where necessary, and ship them to
                        London for realisation, The buyers and sellers alike in Egypt would soon
                        gain confidence in the scheme, if controlled by capable men, because, while
                        developing English trade with Egypt, it would foster the Egyptian trade with
                        England. It would receive the sympathy of the Egyptian Government, and
                        possibly its support in the shape of Government contracts, by reason of the
                        assistance it would render to Egyptian interests. An effort of this kind to
                        intelligent ly develop the trade of both countries would do far more to keep
                        foreign tariffs on their present level, or to reduce them, than pages of
                        protests from British Chambers of Commerce, or even from the British Foreign
                        Office itself.</p>

                    <p>The Executive Committee having called attention to the very limited support

                    <p>HELOUAN NOTES. (FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDÉNT).</p>
                    <p>Helouan, Dec. 24. Helouan, despite the enormous number of visitors going up the
                        river, is holding its own well as a fashionable and popular tourist resort, and
                        has a larger number of visitors than it had during the corresponding period last
                        year. The Grand Hotel, the Tewfik Palace Hotel, and that charming home of
                        health, "Al Hayat," are all doing well. The Tewfik Palace Hotel has at the
                        present moment over fifty visitors. Among the many distinguished tourists who
                        are shortly coming to the Tewfik Palace, is the Earl of Crawford and Balcarres,
                        who is due to arrive there from Luxor on Monday next.</p>
                    <p>The feature of Helouan during the past week has been the encampment of the Royal
                        Engineers, who gave some excellent military sports on Saturday last. They made
                        use of the Helouan Sporting Club's grounds, the grand-stand of which was filled
                        with nearly three hundred persons, representing the cream of Cairo society. Tea
                        was served in the grand lounge of the Tewfik Palace Hotel. The most interesting
                        feature of the event was the Veterans' Race, which was run in grand style by the
                        gallant soldier, General Frederick Lence, C.B., the well-known Anglo-Indian mic
                        litary man. General Lance is going to act as starter in the forthcoming races,
                        to be held by the Helouan Sporting Club on Saturday next, the 31st inst.</p>
                    <p>A very important committee meeting of the Helouan Sporting Club was held on
                        Wednesday last at the Palace of Prince Mohamed Aly Pasha at Cairo. The Prince is
                        patron of the club and takes the greatest interest in its welfare. Prince Abbas
                        Halmi Pasha has lately joined the committee of the club. It has been decided to
                        hold trotting races twice a month. A sub-committee of the club has been formed
                        for the purpose of organising these races. Dr. Bentley was unanimously elected
                        secretary of this subcommittee.</p>
                    <p>On Monday last the Delta Light Railway Company took over the Helouan railway line
                        and great things are expected by the inhabitants of Helouan and the public of
                        Cairo at this new departure. Many prominent AngloEgyptian Government officials
                        have declared that they will reside in Helouan if the tacilities for
                        communication with Cairo are increased and improved.</p>
                    <p>New golf links have been recently made by the Tewfik Palace Hotel for the benefit
                        of the public, free of any charge. The grounds have been laid out by Mr. Hastie,
                        the celebrated golt professional, and should prove a great boon to this popular
                        resort</p>
                    <p>I notice that a great deal of work is being done to the Sporting Club's grounds.
                        The paddock is being enclosed with solid wooden railings.</p>
                    <p>Everything tends to show that Helouan is going to have a record season, for this
                        charming locality was never healthier or in better trim than it is at present.
                        Of course a great many improvements remain to be done, but I am glad to state
                        that the Tanzim Department of the Ministry of Publio Works is awaking to its
                        responsibilities, and that the articles that have appeared in the Egyptian
                        Gazette lately seem to have done some good. But I hear on the best authority
                        that no official financial grant has as yet been accorded to the recent petition
                        of the inhabitants of Helonan, * The competition on the Helouan golf links
                        to-day (Handicap v. Bogey) was not so fully attended as had been anticipated,
                        owing to the number of players that were attracted from Helouan to the Cairo
                        races. In spite of that the handicap was well contested and some fair scores
                        were returned. On the eighteenhole course Mr. A. D. Macdonald won the first
                        prize with a 'two down' and was closely followed by Mr. Stewart Fildes, the
                        winner of last week, and Mr. H. Swift. Mr. H. R. Harrison. who has in former
                        years sent in some excellent scores, has only just returned and was
                        unfortunately not quite on his game.</p>
                    <p>In the nine-hole competition Mrs. PageMay played steady golf and by means of some
                        excellent approaching took first prize with a 'two down', being ono notch better
                        than Mrs. Jebb Scott and Miss Sargent, both redoubtable opponents on these
                        desert links. Mrs. Lye, Mrs. Macdonald, and Miss Hobson among others were hard
                        runners up.</p>
                    <p>The band of the Royal Inniskillings 'discoursed sweet music' on the fine terrace
                        of the Grand Hotel Helouan this afternoon. Many of the residents at this hotel
                        had several visitors from Cairo and as some of the ladies utilised the occasion
                        for the display of recent creations' the scene aided by the brilliant weather
                        was unusually gay and bright</p>
