                <head>NEW JUDICIAL REFORMS. </head>
                   <p> The vernacular Press appears to be greatly disturbed at the
                    new judicial reforms. Our Arabic contemporaries have expressed themselves as
                    strongly opposed to the new scheme of holding Assize Courts whereby they allege
                    that, both as regards the constitution of the Court and the procedural justice
                    is not likely to be impartially administered. It is assumed that the Courts are
                    to be everally constituted of three Counsellors of the Court of Appeal, but with
                    power to the Ministry of Justice to replace one of them by Judge of First
                    Instance. But, of course, ring to the absurd and ostrich-like policy of never
                    taking the publicinto confidence until the Ro icon has been crossed, it is
                    impossible to say whether this surmise is correct. However, assuming that the
                    vox populi is on this occasion accurate, the native | Press appears to have ome
                    reason on its side. The main ground of complaint is that the Judges of First
                    Instance are removable at the will and pleasure of the Ministry of Justice, and
                    that they will therefore think of the permanency of their posts, rather than of
                    the rights of the accused persons who are brought before them. Such con
                    iderations might possibly operate on the minds Of the Judges of First Instance,
                    having regard to the unceremonious way in which their tenure of office has
                    sometimes been treated, and also to the criticisms to which their judgments are
                    abjected by the Judicial Adviser in his Rep its as well as by the "Comité de
                    Surveillance." The other matter which is exercising na ve opinion, as expressed
                    by their newspapers, the revocation of the power of appeal, which abrogates the
                    rights and privileges hitherto enjoyed by persons accused of crime in this
                    country. Upon this point we must admit that a reactionary tendency is
                    observable, seeing that in all other countries the power of appeal is being
                    considerably widened. We cannot of course foreshadow with any degree of
                    certainty what will be the exact methods of procedure, but one thing we most
                    earnestly hope, and that is that no discretionary powers, as regards appeal,
                    will be conferred on the judges, for, one of the wisést who er graced the
                    English Bench in the last century held it as his opinion that the co ferment of
                    such a power placed the judge in most invidious position, for no judge would
                    ser. be likely to grant an appeal when he think that he is right, and he is
                    generally wrong when he thinks himself most right. The native Press asserts that
                    the Legislative Council as a body is dead against the new proposals, but we are
                    afraid that if such be the case, that consideration is hardly likely to carry
                    very great' weight.</p>

                    <p>ST. PETERSBURG, December 27. The Tsar has issued a decree declaring that, in
                        conjunction with the undeviating maintenance and immutability of the
                        fundamental laws of the Empire, it is the duty of the Government to meet any
                        change in the needs of the 1 people when the time is ripe for the same, even
                        though it involves essential innovations in 1 legislation.</p>
                    <p>His Majesty directs his Ministers to consider the possibility of introducing
                        various administrative reforms and to report to him as early as possible.
                        The reforms are not to involve any practical change in the system of
                        government.</p>
                    <p>The proposals include the bringing of the peasant laws into conformity with
                        general legislation, measures for ensuring the application of the law for
                        all alike, the establishing of legal responsibility for arbitrary acts,
                        ensuring independence of the Courts, extension of the powers held by local
                        institutions and measures to make them more representative, the revisiga of
                        exceptional laws against enemies of public order, the introduction of which
                        involved a grave extension of the powers held by the administrative
                        authorities, the revision of religious restrictions, the revision of the
                        disabilities attaching to watives in certain territories, and the revision
                        of the Press laws in order to enable the Press to wortbily fulfil its
                        mission of interpreting reasonable strivings for Russia's advantage.</p>
                    <p>(Reuter.)</p>
                    <p>ST. PETERSBURG, December 27. A rescript of the Tsar announces that he is
                        having reforms studied with a view to giving the peasantry the position of
                        truly free men. Other reforms include the participation of elected bodies in
                        the administration of public affairs, the bettering of the condition of the
                        working classes, the abrogation of the restrictive Press regime, and
                        religious toleration.</p>

                            reform movement initiated by the Zemstvos is alien to the Russian
                            people, who remain true to the old State organisation hallowed by
                            centuries. The Government must oppose any anti Government meeting, State
                            servants being specially held responsible for any contraventions of the
                            law in this respect. The communiqué also calls upon the Press to assist

                    however, at once extinguished. The only damage done in our premises was by the

                <p>The fame of Maple &amp; Co., the largest furnishing establishment in the world,
                    is firmly established here. Our local furniture manufacturers can of course turn
                    out some fair samples of furniture, but they all lack that taste and distinction
                    which are the essential cachet of the workmanship of the great Tottenham
                    Court-road firm. Moreover, Maple's prices compare most favorably with those of
                    local furniture manufacturers, and when the superiority of the workmanship is
                    taken into consideration the real economy of buying furniture direct trom
                    England is apparent. With the facilities for river transport to Cairo and the
                    South. there is very little trouble attached. Messrs. Maple and Co. have
                    arranged for Mr. Oliver, one of their leading representatives, who visited Egypt
                    last year, to be in this country again from the first week in January (the exact

                    <head>THE GARRISON DIRECTORY.</head>
                    <p>There are some rather unaccountable mistakes in the recently published
                        Garrison Directory which seem to show rather careless proofreading. In the
                        list of Under Secretaries of State the names of Messrs. Webb and Perry are
                        omitted, and, stranger still, we learn that the post of Adviser to the
                        Ministry of Finance is filled by Sir William Garstin and Mr. Vincent
                        Corbett. To use a stereotyped phrase, "we have received no official
                        intimation of this important change." It is, of course, a mistake, but the
                        world in general, while indulgent to those who misspell addresses, and
                        capable even of pardoning those who deprive Browne of its "e" and commit
                        equally grave offences against the integrity of surnames, is disposed to be
                        exacting when the posts and titles of some of the most important officials
                        in the country are in question.</p>

                    <byline>RE-ORGANISATION OF GHAFFARIAN</byline>
                    <p>Keneh, December The new system of ghaffar organise on which is being
                        instituted by the Interior will, it is hoped, be successful in lessening the
                        number of crimes and securing greater safety to the residents. Mr. A. W.
                        Hazel, Interior Inspector, and Mohamed Ali Bey, the Keneb Sub-Mudir, are
                        arranging for carrying out his work in the markaz of Keneh. Ghaffars are
                        being chosen who can be depended on in time of need. The old ghafars have
                        been mostly dismissed. There are two relays of watchmen, one for day work
                        and the other for night. A day ghaffar is to be paid P.T. 60 in the villages
                        and P.T. 75 in the towns. The night ghaffar is to have P.T. 90 in the
                        villages and P.T. 100 in the bandars. The “Sheikh El-Gafar" in the villages
                        will have from P.T. 150 up to P.T. 200, while that of the bandar will have
                        P.T. 300,</p>
                    <p>There is also an employé called mulab of ghaffirs who is to be appointed from
                        the pensioned employés. His principal duty is to make a night patrol with
                        the ghaffirsthin a radius of 5,000 feddans. This man is not under the orders
                        of the Omdeh, but reports to the Markaz directly. His pay is to be P.1500
                        &amp; month.</p>
                    <p>A meeting was held in the Keneh Markaz this morning for the distribution of
                        grants-in-aid to the fikis of kuttabs. The Mudir, the Inspector, the
                        headmaster of the Government school, and many of the notables of the town
                        were prosent. Before the grants were distributed, a chapter from the Koran
                        was recited. The Inspektor of Kuttabs, Sheikh Abd-ul-ate Hallal, made a
                        long! speech to the fikis, exhorting them to maintain order, organisation,
                        and activity in their work, and comparing the great success of the kuttabs
                        this year with that of last year, and explaining the cause of the happy
                        results. The Mudir, Gamal Eddin Bey, also spoke.</p>

                    <byline>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN. GAZETTE.</byline>
                    <p>Sir, I was disagreeably surprised to read in the Gazette this afternoon &amp;
                        scarcely disguised reflection on the better classes of the Hellenic
                        community of Alexandria, contained in the extracts you published from the
                        Note of the Financial Adviser on the Budget for 1905. That high official
                        states that hashish smuggling reflects unfairly, "especially on the numerous
                        and respected Hellenic community of Alexandria.". In view of the very
                        cordial relations, which have always existed between the Hellenic colony and
                        the English, espeo y at Alexandria, I must stigmatise this reflection as
                        unjustifiable and unwarranted Your newspaper is read by a great many Breeks
                        throughout Egypt and has been characterised by its sympathetic attitude
                        toward the community, 80 the publicity which the Judicial Adviser's
                        strictures will obtain must be a cause of deep annoyance to many ireeks
                        throughout this country. The insinuations are unfair and misleading in the
                        extreme. For example, can Mr. Benachi or Mr. Sinadino be considered in any
                        way responsible for hashish smuggling any more than can any of the
                        respectable members of the British colony be held liable for drunkenness
                        among British sailors or soldiers at Alexandria 1 The Financial Adviser
                        states that the leaders of the Hellenic community at Alexandria "åre no less
                        interested than the Egyptian authorities in pung an end to the present state
                        of things." 1 is an incontestable assertion, but it would have been far
                        better unsaid. The paragraph is he led "A Plain Hint," and you have justly
                        conveyed the general impression which it must reste in every reader's mind
                        by this title. I fail to see why the respectable members of the Hellenic
                        community should be saddled with this disgraceful imputation by the
                        Financial Adviser, any more than the respectable members of the French
                        colonies here should be held responsible for the presence of Parisian
                        demi-mondaines in Egypt. If Alexandria was as near to an English port as it
                        is to the Piræus. I am gure that the British colony in Egypt would have as
                        many "mauvais sujets' ' as we have, and it is only owing to the contiguity
                        of Egypt to Greece and Southern Italy, that the Greek and Italian
                        communities here have so many undesirable members among them. To hold an
                        entire community responsible for the misdeeds of a few of its members is
                        utterly unfair and it is most regrettable that the first Note, which the
                        newly-appointed Financial Adviser has issued, should be characterised by
                        suoh &amp; sad error of judgment.</p>
