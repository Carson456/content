                    <p>While we hope that the correspondence in our columns which has followed the
                        recent lamentable death of a young Englishman in the Deaconesses' Hospital
                        will be productive of some result, and that the establishment of an isolated
                        small-pox hospital for the treatment of Europeans who may be attacked by
                        that terrible disease is a thing of the near future, we also sincerely trust
                        that the occasion may not be made the opportunity for an attack on the
                        excellent institution at which the death of Yousbashi Armstrong took place.
                        Englishmen should be thankful that such an institution as the Deaconesses'
                        Hospital exists in Alexandria. We know of a case-a surgical ne-treated there
                        last year with the utmost </p>
                    <p>medical skill and nursing attention, both successful to a degree that would
                        have reflected</p>
                    <p>the highest credit on the best of our London | hospitals. The patient, a
                        clerk in the office of one of our great shipping companies, came to Egypt
                        with his wife for the benefit of a sea voyage, but was in so seriousa state
                        on his arrival that an operation of a difficult nature had to be performed.
                        The wife remained in the hospital with ar husband during the few weeks he
                        staye. there, the charge for board and residence in both cases being, we
                        believe, P.140 per day. They at least, have occasion to be thankful for the
                        existence of the Deaconesses' Hospital and for the medical skill Drs.
                        Morrison and Nauphal, supplemented, as it was, by the excellent nursing of
                        the devoted women who, without monetary recompense, so carefully and
                        cheerfully attend the sick pe lients uuder their charge. While Englishmer
                        can receive such attention as this, it seems somewhat premature to think of
                        establishing en English Cottage Hospital here, especially in view of the
                        limited success that has attended the Anglo-American Hospital in Cairo,
                        where the English-speaking residents far outuumber tholb in Alexandria aud
                        where even the influentii support the new institution has received from Lord
                        Cromer and others has failed to bring in its trait the general support
                        without which sucess is impossible.</p>

                        death from bovine typhus which has been noted dring the last month may be
                        easily exaggera , and while there is no reason to apprehānd any really heavy

                        guine hopes of an early and complete disappearance of the epidemic. It is
                        probable that univourable climatic conditions, want of sun, raid weather,
                        etc., are to a large degree responsibl for this increase, but not a few men
                        who are qualified to advance their opinions of the subject are inclined to
                        consider it probal le that the cattle plague will continue with us for
                        another two years, though the inocilation of surviving animals and other med

                        exhausts itself, i.e., becomes in popular parlance “worked out,” will
                        prevent any mortality on a large scale in the future.</head>

                    <byline>STORES GUTTED.</byline>
                    <byline>ENORMOUS DAMAGE.</byline>
                    <p>At an early hour this morning, a destructive fire broke out in the very heart
                        of Alexandria. The scene of the conflagration was the Old Exchange Buildings
                        (Palais de l'Ancienne Bourse). The north portion of the ground floor of this
                        block of buildings is occupied by the editorial and printing offices of the
                        Egyptian Gazette, the large store of Messrs. Walker and Meimarachi, Limited,
                        is in the centre, while on the south side is the large and luxuriously
                        appointed bar belonging to the same firm. The whole of the upper portion of
                        the building is used as a cigarette factory, and belongs to Messrs. E.
                        Laurens &amp; Co., the manager of which firm is the owner of the
                        building.</p>
                    <p>It is believed that the fire arose through the fusing of some electric wires
                        affixed to the ceiling at the back of Messrs. Walker &amp; Meimarachi's bar,
                        where the grill is situated. Shortly before 2 o'clock, while the bar was
                        still open, one of the employés saw that the ceiling in this part of the
                        establishment was on fire. The habitués and bar tenders quickly! evacuated
                        the building, and by the time the Alexandria Fire Brigade made its
                        appearance, the fire had gained great hold over the inflammable contents,
                        and had spread to the bar. The flames leaped across the street, and if a
                        strong wind had been blowing Saint Mark's Buildings would have caught fire,
                        as well as the great pile of buildings which have been erected by Messrs.
                        Allen and Alderson on the other side of Old Bourse-street. Fortunately the
                        scaffolding around the latter building has recently been taken down.
                        Otherwise it would inevitably have caught. Owing to the exertions of the
                        Fire Brigade, under the command of Miralai Wapkinson Bey, Commandant of the
                        Alexandria City Police, and of the superintendent of the Fire Brigade, Sagh.
                        Lynn, the fire was prevented from spreading across the street, but it gained
                        complete mastery over the bar, which was absolutely gutted. The fire made
                        its way to the cigarette manufactory on the first floor, and dense volumes
                        of smoke came from the upper windows, while it spread with equal swiftuess
                        to the grocery and provision stores in the centre on the ground floor. The
                        entrances and windows of this store were broken into and the firemen pourel
                        an endless stream of water on the contents, which included a great supply of
                        valuable 'Xmas and New Year presents. Almost all the goods were destroyed by
                        the fire or rendered valueless by the water.</p>
                    <p>It is as yet impossible to determine the extent of the loss either in the
                        case of the property of Messrs. Walker &amp; Meimarachi or of Messrs.
                        Laurens &amp; Co. The fire was got well under control by 5 o'clock, and was
                        successfully prevented from reaching our offices. Some idea of the
                        fierceness of the fames may be gathered, however, when we state that Mr.
                        Spathis's bar and Mr. Ipekian's cigarette stores opposite suffered. The
                        frontage of the latter was almost totally destroyed by the heat acting on
                        the woodwork and glass.</p>

                    <p>Mr. D. K. Reid, of the firm of Reid and Barnard, writes to us on 'Xmas Day,
                        from "between Assiout and Luxor," giving the following account of his
                        experiences in the recent accident:</p>
                    <p>It has been my misfortune to have taken my part for a second time in an
                        accident on the Egyptian State Railways. I was a passenger in the train
                        which was thrown off the rails at Kafr Dawar three years ago, and I was
                        again &amp; passenger last night in the express "train de luxe" which was
                        partially wrecked by a collision at Kafr Ammar. Our situation as passengers
                        w precisely similar to that in which we found ourselves before, with the
                        unfortunate difference that whereason that occasion weli had finished our
                        dinner, we had on this occasion barely begun it, and the interruption was
                        such as to preclude all possibility of continuing it.</p>
                    <p>Almost all the passengers, I think, were in the diping-car when the collision
                        occurred. | ! Fortunately they were few in number and only filled one half
                        of it, for, as you know, it is divided into two compartments. Had the other
                        half, that nearest to the kitchen, contained passengers, the results would
                        have been very 12 serious. As it was, of the three men who were at the
                        moment either in this section of the car, or in the kitchen, one European
                        waiter was badly cut and bruised; another was taken out with his leg broken
                        and other injuries ;|I and the native cook was so badly crushed that he died
                        &amp; few hours later. The shock of the collision was severe. The dining-car
                        was only separated from the engine and tender by at brake and luggage van.
                        This was driven right into the dining car, annihilating the kitchen and
                        two-thirds of one section; the wreckage which it carried with it stopping
                        within a few feet of the door leading into the other part where the
                        passengers were seated.</p>
                    <p>None of the carriages which made up the lo train left the line, and though
                        the lights in the dining-car were extinguished by the lo shock, there was
                        little confusion, and beyond | a few bruises no passenger received anyu
                        injuries.</p>
                    <p>The position of the engines left no doubt as to how the accident occurred.
                        They were locked together in close embrace as men who wrestle. For reasons
                        no doubt good in them-li selves, the up train to Cairo was stationary | 1 at
                        the Kafr Ammar platform on the down line. This appears to bave either
                        provoked the ire or appealed to the sporting instinctst of the "train de
                        luxe" mecanicien, who, disregarding all signals to the contrary, made for
                        the stationary train at &amp; pace which Ilt presume he considered necessary
                        to effect its removal. The results, if not in precise la accordance with his
                        expectations, were sufficiently important to warrant his detention.</p>
                    <p>Everything possible was done for the comfort and convenience of travellers by
                        the officials of the aministration and the sleeping-car service; and a
                        series of free meals was provided It between Minieh and Luxor as
                        compensation for the loss of the restaurant car dinner. At the same time I
                        should like to appeal to the railway It authorities to act with more
                        despatoh after such regrettable incidents, in forwarding pas- sengers to
                        their destinations. On this occasioni an engine was on the spot soon after
                        the acci- t dent, and it would have been the matter of an If hour or two at
                        most to have detached the lo uninjured carriages and sent them down to Ayat,
                        where the 8 p.m. express from Cairo was r in waiting and together with the
                        sleeping car could have been made up into one trainnecessarily with two
                        engines--and sent on its</p>
                    <p>ay to Luxor. This was in fact the course adopted; unfortunately it was
                        thought necessary to maintain the uninjured cars in situ until the arrival
                        of railway officials from Cairo, with the result that &amp; delay which
                        should have been of two hours was prolonged into one of eight. I should not
                        have called attention to this, had I not a vivid recollection of a similar
                        delay which followed the Kafr Dawar accident, when within a few miles of
                        Alexandria we were left for five hours, bereft of food and drink, to the
                        tender mercies of the mosquitoes which infest that neighbourhood.</p>

                        interesting details on the subject of the Fête Comunittee for Cairo. The
                        idea is a good one and we are glad to see that the scheme, which we have
                        advocated for years past, has at last taken definite shape. With such names
                        as those of Maitre Carton de Wiart, Major Kenney-Herbert, M. Cattaoui, the
                        Hon. F. C. Morgan, Mr. Chas. Baebler, Nungovich Bey, Omar Bey Sultan, and
                        Mr. Aspinali, we have no doubt that the efforts of the committee will meet
                        with every success, provided that the public show some response in backing
                        them up. The expenses will, of course, be considerable and we believe that
                        it is estimated that over | £3,000 will have to be spent this season.
                        The</p>
                    <p>committee have decided to issue posters every month giving a list of the
                        fêtes which are to take place, and handbills will also be distributed
                        throughout the hotels and leading resorts. The committee will also institute
                        various forms of amusement and entertainment for our visitors and we shall
                        be glad to aid as much as lies in our power towards the successful
                        attainment! of such a scheme. That something in this line can be done was
                        evidenced by the great , success that attended the bataille de fleurs which
                        was held in the grounds of the Ghezireh Casino last March by a small

                        admirable. The fine anthem, "In the beginning was the Word," by Allen, was

                    <head>ST. ANDREW'S CHURCH, CAIRO. On Sunday lasť Christmas services were held in
                        this church morning and evening, the officiating clergyman on both occasions
                        being the Rev. A. C. W. Saunders, résident Scottish chaplain. Through the
                        kindness of members of the congregation and others, the church was
                        beautifully decorated for the occasion with evergreens and flowers. At the
                        morning service there was a large congregation, who joined heartily in the
                        singing, which included the well-known Christmas hymns "O come all ye 13
                        faithful" and "Hark the herald angels sing." Mr. Saunders took as his text
                        Revelation 3,</head>
                    <p>14, The Beginning of the creation of God." | There were, be said, two
                        creations, the old and the new; and as the Pre-Incarnate think the Eternal
                        Word was the beginning of the one, 80 was the lucernate Christ the beginning
                        of the other. When man had fallen, it was God's purpose to restore the
                        Divine Image in him and re-create him after a new pattern. This He did by
                        infusing into him a new life from a new source. And the new source was the
                        Incarnation of Jesus Christ. The work of the new creation began on the day
                        when Son of God assumed our flesh. Christ took nature that He might
                        transform it anew,that lle might enliven it with His perfect life, Hof an
                        and Divine. Christmas was thus the fival of the beginning of God's new
                        creatit. They celebrated this day the birthday of One who ushered in a new
                        era in the biste sy of the Universe. They kept Christmas as a pemorial that
                        God had stooped to be born fter the flesh in order that man might be bean
                        anew of the Spirit.--A celebration of H y Communion followed, at which

                    in port, was one of the most enjoyable evening entertainments given there for
                    some time. The ball was simply packed, and tho thanks of all present are due to
                    the host and hostess, Admiral Sir Massie and Lady Blomfi id, as also to the
                    ladies and gentlemen who so sindly helped with the musical portion. A capit
                    programme was provided, and the hearty applause and recalls testified to its
                    appreciation by the audience. Mr. Hugh Blomfield opened with a couple of violin
                    solos (a) Berceuse Blave (6) Perpetuo Mobile, rendered in quite &amp; masterly
                    manner. Miss Cohu then sang with much tasto "The sweetest girl in Dixie,” Mr.
                    Nixon following with a capital rendering of "The Outpost's Vigil," and as an
                    encore he gave “Will o' the Wisp." Some selections from the "Cingalee" were next
                    given. The very pretty quartette, "Spite of all that Lovers 10," sung by Lady
                    Blomfield, Miss MunGavin and Messrs. Nixon ar 1 Purvis, well deserved its
                    encore, as also Mr. Byrne's Cingalee and Mr. Hugh Blomfield's clever
                    impersonation of Chambuddy Ram in the comic songs That's all right" and "The
                    Wonderful E lish Pot," which brought the first part of the entertainment to
                    &amp; close amidst peals of cughter.</p>

                    concert commenced with a piano solo, a selection from "The Belle of New York,"
                    played by Miss Cohu in a spirited manner. The great feature of the evening's
